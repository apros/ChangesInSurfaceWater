# ChangesInSurfaceWater
using satellite imagery and deep learning image segmentation algorithms to assess changes to freshwater resources over time

Task will be to design and optimize a robust algorithm to identify water in satellite images, automatically and with high accuracy.

Comparing past water resources with those of the present helps us understand how past societal and economic decisions can contribute to more informed management decisions in the future. Analysis of water resources over time is important to investigate patterns in migration and economy. It is also important for global problems, such as climate change that lead to fluctuations in water levels (decreases in water levels in some places and increases in others).

The exponential growth of satellite-based information over the past four decades has provided unprecedented opportunities to improve water resources management. Much of this satellite data is freely available. Using publicly available datasets and European Space Agency Sentinel 2 satellite imagery.

My task here is to design and implement a machine learning algorithm that will automatically detect the occurrence of water pixels in Sentinel 2 imagery. You will use a set of state-of-the-art machine learning tools for image classification called deep learning.

Deep learning is the use of very large artificial neural networks, often with millions of parameters, for classification and regression tasks. The type of classification task you will develop is called semantic segmentation, which is the classification of each pixel in an image (hence segmentation) into one of a few pre-specified discrete labels/classes (hence semantic). A segmentation algorithm with only two classes is a binary segmentation algorithm. A specific form of deep learning algorithm known as a convolutional neural network or CNN has consistently shown state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks. You will learn a type of CNN-based models suitable to image segmentation, called a U-Net. You will learn how to modify the U-Net model to suit your specific purposes. This project will give you the basic understanding of how all these algorithms work.
